Hello!  

The Bucket List Trapper Keeper allows users to keep track of bucket list ideas or experiences that they would like to complete before the end of their life. The user has their own dashboard but also has access to the community dashboard. On the user dashboard, they have ideas that need to be completed and ideas that have been completed.  They can set a time frame of when they want to complete the ideas so they can prioritize what needs to be done first. 

The community dashboard purpose was to inspire the user on ideas to add to their own board.  The user has the option to search all users' ideas and then choose if they want to add them to their own list. I also included a random generated option as well to randomly generate an idea. 

The purpose of this app is to help people accomplish all the things they want to accomplish in their life.

Bucket List Trapper Keeper is built in React.js and styled with react bootstrap and MUI libraries for React.  I used two libraries to be able to obtain the features I wanted for the app.  

This app is utlizes on a mock Restful ran on JSON-Server.

# Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
